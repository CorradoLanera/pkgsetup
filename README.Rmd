The goal of `{pkgsetup}` is to provide a complete step-by-step example of
package setup, commit history included. The intention is to report the
ground procedure to setup a robust production-ready, reproducible,
framework for high quality projects.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with the following procedure:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CorradoLanera/pkgsetup")
```




## Usage

This package is here only to provide a blueprint for a full package
setup. You can look at its structure, and you can find all the setup
flow procedure into the file
[`dev/01-setup.R`](https://github.com/CorradoLanera/pkgsetup/blob/master/dev/01-setup.R).
You can also take a look at the history of the commits.

Happy Projecting!
